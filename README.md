This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Important Notes

Two branches : main with the search functionality implemented but a more intrincate code and lite with no search functionality and more simple and elegant code

## Third-party Libraries

- Axios (More simple way of doing fetching)
- Bcrypt (For the work of cryptography on the authentication process)
- jose ( The same of Bcrypt but more focused on JWT )
